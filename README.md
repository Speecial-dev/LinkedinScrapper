# LinkedinScrapper
Welcome to the LinkedIn Scrapper project!

In this project, we use the Python programming language and the Selenium and BeautifulSoup libraries.

To examine the project, you will need to fill in the email and password sections.

The linkedinscrapper.py file is used to retrieve the job IDs of search results based on a specific keyword, and then uses these job IDs to scrape various information from the corresponding links.

Still in Progress:
1- The page length is manually specified, so the number of pages will be determined
2- The outputs are not stored anywhere, so Excel will be used
3- When scraping data, priority is still not yet determined, this priority will be established
