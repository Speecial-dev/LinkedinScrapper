# LinkedinScrapper
Welcome to the LinkedIn Scrapper project!

In this project, we use the Python programming language and the Selenium and BeautifulSoup libraries.

To examine the project, you will need to fill in the email and password sections.

The linkedinscrapper.py file is used to retrieve the job IDs of search results based on a specific keyword, and then uses these job IDs to scrape various information from the corresponding links.
